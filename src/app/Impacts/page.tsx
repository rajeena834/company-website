                            Through our brands and platforms, OLX aims to make<br />
                            secondhand the first choice. Giving products another life<br />
                            means we don’t need to pull as many new resources<br />
                            from our already pressured planet. And it helps bring<br />
                            value to products otherwise discarded or left lying<br />
                            around. There are so many products out there that can<br />
                            easily be used a second or third time, so why not make<br />
                            the most of what we already have?

                            While our platforms already facilitate reuse (second and third lives for household goods and vehicles), we are taking steps to extend<br />
                            the role we play into refurbishment and recycle phases.<br /><br />

                            Notably, in our OLX Autos cars transaction business, in 2022 we will kick off a pilot program in India to unlock value of “end of life” vehicles through efficiently sourcing cars that have reached the end of their natural lives, distributing them to best-in-class recycling operations, while paying a fair price to the vehicle owner.

                            In Poland, our OLX team is partnering with the national postal service to collect e-waste (phones, tablets, laptops) to efficiently collect and recycle the metals and raw materials and return them back into the supply chain.

                            We have invested into Cashify, India’s leading electronics refurbishment company, who delivers refurbished phones with warranties to consumers to bring high-quality devices to consumers while reducing overall demand for new production.

                            These are but a few of the experiments that our teams are undertaking as we build new business models which bring value and offer multiple circular solutions to our customers.
